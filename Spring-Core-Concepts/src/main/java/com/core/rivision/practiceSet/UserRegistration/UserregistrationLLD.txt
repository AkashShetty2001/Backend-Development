Question 3: User Registration (Bean Lifecycle)

Problem
Create a user registration service where:
On bean creation → open DB connection (mock)
On bean destruction → close DB connection (mock)

Requirements
Use bean lifecycle callbacks

Print logs for:

Constructor
Post initialization
Pre destruction

Constraints

Use annotations (@PostConstruct, @PreDestroy)
Use Java config
Gracefully close the container

Concepts tested
✔ Bean lifecycle
✔ Init & destroy callbacks
